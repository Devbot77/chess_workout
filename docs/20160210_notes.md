Meeting Notes

Updated player association to pull white and black players through the game model

  ```
  belongs_to :white_player, class_name: "User", foreign_key: :white_player_id
  ```

Update Player create

    white_player = Player.find(game_params[:white_player_id])

    # Non-pawns for white player:
    Rook.create(color: "white", x_position: 1, y_position: 8, game_id: game.id, player_id: white_player.id)


Move a Piece (Rules)

  - Verify that the move is valid for the piece Type
    - Define the rules for each specific model
    - Origin - we know where the piece is now
    - Destination - we know where the piece is going
    - Comparing the X and Y coordinates of the origin and destination
      - Direction (subtract the origin from the destination)
      - Distance (subtract the origin from the destination)

      - Pawn - Clear path, not capturing any pieces
        - 2 spaces max (2 on first turn, 1 on any other turn)
        - Only in the Y direction that is away from the player's edge (based on color), except for capturing

        may or may not be obstructed
        -
        consider the pawn at 1,0
        possible moves:
          2,0
          3,0 if first move
          2,1 if capturing

  - Determine if the path is blocked (and is that OK - Knight can jump)?
  - Determine if the destination has a piece on it
  - Verify that it is the player's turn that is attempting to move

Functionality

  - Send through a piece id, destination
  - Determine if it is a valid move
  - If so, we will update the position of the piece
